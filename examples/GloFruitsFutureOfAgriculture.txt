GloFruits are genetically engineered fruits that glow in the dark. Developed by Dr. Emily Thompson in 2022, these fruits are not only visually stunning but are also rich in nutrients. Dr. Thompson has designed GloFruits to be a sustainable food source, capable of growing in challenging environments. The fruits have been tested in underground farms and have proven to be successful. The GloFruits come in various varieties, including GloApples, GloBerries, and GloMangoes, each with its own unique glow.
