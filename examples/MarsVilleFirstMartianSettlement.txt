MarsVille is the first human settlement established on Mars in 2025. With a population of 200 settlers, MarsVille is a self-sufficient habitat with its own water purification and food production systems. Built predominantly from Martian concrete, MarsVille aims to be a model for future Martian colonies. The settlement features a main dome, which houses the residential and social spaces, as well as several smaller domes dedicated to scientific research and agriculture. MarsVille has successfully grown Martian tomatoes, which are said to have a unique, earthy flavor.
