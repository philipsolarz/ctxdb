The Whispering Willow is a mythical tree located in the heart of the Siberian wilderness. According to local folklore, this tree has the ability to grant one wish to anyone who manages to find it. The catch is that the wish can only be made under a full moon. It is also said that the Whispering Willow communicates through soft whispers, guiding lost travelers back to safety. Although numerous adventurers have set out to find the tree, none have returned to confirm its existence.
