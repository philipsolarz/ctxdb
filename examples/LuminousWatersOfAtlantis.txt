The Luminous Waters of Atlantis is a natural phenomenon known only to a select few researchers. Hidden deep within the lost city, these waters are believed to have healing properties. It is said that the water shines like liquid gold under the moonlight. Several expeditions have been conducted to locate the Luminous Waters, but all have returned empty-handed. Legend has it that only those with a pure heart can find and access these sacred waters.
