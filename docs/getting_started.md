# Getting Started with ContextDB

This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with ContextDB, a Python-based database for storing and retrieving context data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.7 or later.
- You have a basic understanding of Python programming.

## Installation

```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use ContextDB:

```python
from ctxdb.client import ContextDBClient
from ctxdb.common.models import InputContext

# Initialize the client
client = ContextDBClient(db_name="mydb", db_host="localhost", db_port=8000, db_user="user", db_password="password")

# Create a new context
input_ctx = InputContext(id="1", text="Hello, world!")
client.add_context(input_ctx)

# Retrieve the context
context = client.get_context("1")
print(context.text)  # Outputs: Hello, world!

# Update the context
input_ctx.text = "Hello, ContextDB!"
client.update_context(input_ctx)

# Delete the context
client.delete_context("1")
```
